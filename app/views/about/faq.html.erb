  <i> The StopInfo project is currently in maintenance-only mode.  (The UW students who worked on it have graduated, and unfortunately we currently don't have any funding for the project.) We are looking for a new student volunteer to take it on.  In the meantime we will try to keep the system going, but will be unable to add improvements or make other changes.  For questions in the meantime please contact <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/borning/">Alan Borning</a>. </i>

	<a name="how-stopinfo-works"></a><b>How does StopInfo work?</b><br/>
	StopInfo combines data about bus stops from King County Metro 
	along with information provided directly by users of the application. The system chooses which information to display 
	according to a majority voting system. A field is considered as 'verified' when it receives
	at least 75% of the same vote; otherwise, the majority answer is displayed as 'unverified.' 
	Categories that have information provided by at least one source will appear 
	on the stop information page.<br/> <a href ="#top">[top]</a>
	<br/><br/>
	<a name="who-stopinfo-helps"></a><b>Who does StopInfo benefit?</b><br/>
	StopInfo is meant to be a tool for everyone who wishes to have information about transit stops as they travel. For example,
	StopInfo provides information about whether stops are currently closed, or if the stop has good lighting at night. However,
	we specifically collect information that has been identified by blind and low vision transit riders to be useful when trying to
	locate transit stops. <br/> <a href ="#top">[top]</a>

	<a name="how-you-can-help"></a><b>How can I help?</b><br/>
	Next time you are waiting at a bus stop, you can add or verify stop information by clicking on the 'Add/verify information' link at the bottom of that stop's information page. Details about the landmarks we are looking for are described by tapping the '?' icon next to each field, or on <%= link_to 'this page', "/about/fields" %>. You can also report temporary or permanent stop closures by tapping the 'Report closure' link on the relevant stop's information page. You can go back and edit stop information at any time if you choose to <a href = "/login/">log in with a Facebook or Google account</a> before adding information.<br/> <a href ="#top">[top]</a>
	<br/><br/>
	<a name="onebusaway"></a><b>Is StopInfo an extension of OneBusAway?</b><br/>
	Yes and no. StopInfo is currently a research project at the University of Washington (where OneBusAway was created) and is only integrated into the iOS version of OneBusAway for the Puget Sound region. The system may be integrated into all OneBusAway platforms in the future, and possibly extend to other regions that OneBusAway covers as well.<br/> <a href ="#top">[top]</a>
	<br/><br/>
	<a name="stop-presence"></a><b>Do I need to be present at a stop to enter information?</b><br/>
	No, you do not need to be currently present at the stop for which you are entering information. However, we recommend that you are physically present at the time of contribution in order to ensure that all stop landmarks can be fully perceived. If you need to get on a bus while in the process of entering information, you may submit only the fields that you were able to observe. You can also check and edit your information for a stop later if you wish by looking up the stop on <a href= "https://www.google.com/maps/@47.654268,-122.305134,3a,30y,205.93h,84.14t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1s8KrVHPFsWkig6wmavcHpdg!2e0!6m1!1e1" target = "_blank">Google Street View</a>. (Note: some features of a stop may be obscured in these photos by vehicles or pedestrians.) <br/> <a href ="#top">[top]</a>
