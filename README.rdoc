== StopInfo

The StopInfo application is a Ruby on Rails web app with an SQL backend. 
''Caveat: the site evolved from an early prototype and as such is heavily tailored to the 
original information source and may contain other prototype-related temporary hacks 
and design flaws.'' It is not suited for multi-region use in its current state.

The live KCM version of the code runs on helsinki, /var/www/sites/stopinfo. To 
change the http://stopinfo.pugetsound.onebusaway.org/ site all changes must be 
pulled into this directory.
